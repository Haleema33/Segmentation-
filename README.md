## Overview

This repository implements state-of-the-art segmentation models and provides scripts for training, evaluating, and visualizing results. It is designed to be modular and extensible, enabling easy experimentation with different architectures and datasets.

## Features

- Modular codebase for rapid prototyping of segmentation models
- Support for popular architectures (e.g., U-Net, DeepLab, FCN)
- Data preprocessing and augmentation utilities
- Training pipeline with checkpointing and logging
- Evaluation scripts for qualitative and quantitative analysis
- Visualization tools for segmented outputs
- Easy integration of custom datasets

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Haleema33/Segmentation-.git
   cd Segmentation-
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- To train a segmentation model:
  ```bash
  python train.py --config configs/unet_config.yaml
  ```
- To evaluate a trained model:
  ```bash
  python evaluate.py --model checkpoints/unet_best.pth --data data/test
  ```
- To visualize segmentation results:
  ```bash
  python visualize.py --input data/sample.jpg --model checkpoints/unet_best.pth
  ```

## Supported Models

- U-Net
- DeepLabV3
- FCN (Fully Convolutional Network)
- Custom models (easily extendable)

## Dataset

Out-of-the-box support for VOC, COCO, and custom datasets. Ensure your dataset follows the required directory and annotation format.

## Training

Customizable training parameters (epochs, batch size, learning rate) via configuration files.

## Evaluation

Quantitative metrics (IoU, Dice coefficient) and qualitative visualizations.

## Results

Trained model weights and sample outputs are saved in the `results/` and `checkpoints/` directories. Example segmentation results are provided for reference.
